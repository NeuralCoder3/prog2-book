<aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">MIPS was one of the early RISC processor designs that emerged in the early 1980s. Its instruction set is very uniform and simple and therefore well-suited for an introduction to machine code programming. It is the spiritual ancestor to the RISC-V instruction set architecture which has gained significant traction in recent years. For the sake of simplicity, we are considering one of the earlier, 32-bit ISA definitions because they are less complex than later ISA extensions.</div></aside><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-asm-mips.html#aside-3" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
