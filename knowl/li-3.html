<div class="para">I consider it important that students are able to identify the different levels of abstractions that are at work in programming and they can mentally move between these abstractions without problems. Seeing a C/C++ program and actually having a vague idea of what happens on the machine is not only helpful to eliminate “cargo cult” thinking but also vital when it comes to performance or security considerations. Therefore, the course intentionally starts with computer arithmetic and machine code programming to convey an impression on how programs execute at the lowest level. This enables an understanding of the abstractions higher-level imperative languages provide to make programming machines more bearable and scalable, what these abstractions actually abstract from, and what the cost of these abstractions are.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface.html#li-3" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
