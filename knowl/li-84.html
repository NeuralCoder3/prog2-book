<div class="para">Tests are written only with respect to a specification. The code of the subject to test does not have an influence on the test itself. </div>
<div class="para">The advantage is that black-box testing can, because it is based on a specification, uncover missing code if some cases have not been considered or implemented. On the other hand, because it ignores the structure of the program to test, it may be that some code paths are not covered by a black-box test suite.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-corr-testing.html#li-84" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
