<div class="para">Object-oriented programming languages help to solve an important problem for developing large software systems: easy extensibility. “Easy” here means that extending the system only requires changes at a small number of confined program locations. This is important since modifications that address many program locations are very prone to mistakes: A developer that performs such modifications needs to understand the entire code affected by the changes to ensure that the modification is correct and complete. Object-oriented languages facilitate this by providing means that, if used properly, confine the required changes for an extension of the program. The following properties of object-oriented languages are central for this goal:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">The <em class="emphasis">separation of interface and implementation</em> is helpful for implementing abstract data types. This supports extensibility since code can refer to the interface rather than a concrete implementation. Subtyping ensures that all extensions provide the functionality required by the interface.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The <em class="emphasis">concentration of data and corresponding code in a class</em> prevents implementation details from being scattered among large parts of the code and from being used by code parts that actually do not need them.</div></li>
</ul>
