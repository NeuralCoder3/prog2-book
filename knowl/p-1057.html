<dfn class="terminology">Syntax-directed code generation</dfn> is a very simple way of generating machine code from an abstract syntax tree. We traverse the abstract syntax tree recursively, generate code for each child of a node individually and combine these codes with code that comes from the node itself. This technique is very easy to implement because it can be done in a simple recursive AST traversal. However, the quality of the code is usually very low because the code generator lacks a “global view” of the code. To generate high-quality code, more advanced techniques are needed which are out of the scope of this text. Here, we only want to get a first impression of how higher-level languages are implemented with machine code.</div>
