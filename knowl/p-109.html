<div class="para">Machine code is very primitive, does not contain a lot of concepts, and is very close to the machine. By learning machine code, we get an understanding of the lowest abstraction in programming, the so-called <dfn class="terminology">hardware-software interface</dfn>, which is essentially how software “talks” to hardware. Understanding what happens at the machine code level is relevant in many situations: For example, many software security problems exploit the fact that some programming languages cannot really abstract the machine code level entirely which can be exploited to “make the program behave” in an unintended way. Another example is performance optimization: If code needs to run as fast as possible, engineers often look at the machine code generated from a compiler to understand possible performance bottlenecks. Sometimes performance-critical code is even written in machine code. </div>
