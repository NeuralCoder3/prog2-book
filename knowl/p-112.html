<div class="para">A computer consists of several different components (CPU, memory, input/output) that all communicate via a shared bus. The bus serves as the central means of communication that connects all components of the system. It is just a “bunch of wires” that can be accessed (written to and read from) by all components. Busses essentially avoid the overhead of n:n connections between the components at the price of the fact that only one bus participant can write to the bus at one point in time. </div>
