<div class="para">A core abstraction that is common in most computers is that of addressable memory. The system has an <dfn class="terminology">address space</dfn>, i.e.Â a range of natural numbers that each stands for the <dfn class="terminology">address</dfn> by which a piece of data (commonly a byte) can be accessed. That data does not necessarily has to be stored in one single memory. Input-output devices can blend in parts of their memory in the global address space to make it accessible by all bus participants. The <dfn class="terminology">central processing unit (CPU)</dfn> where all computations take place is also just a bus participant. It obtains and provides the data it computes on via the bus to the rest of the system. </div>
