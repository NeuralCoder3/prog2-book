<div class="para">In this section, we introduce the instruction set architecture (ISA) of the <dfn class="terminology">MIPS processor</dfn>. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/asm-fig-schematic.html" title="Figure 2.1.1">Figure 2.1.1</a> shows a conceptual overview over a computer with a MIPS processor. Of course, a concrete implementation is much more complex but we are focussing on the parts that are relevant for learning machine code programming. So from this very high-level perspective, a MIPS processor contains an <dfn class="terminology">arithmetic logical unit (ALU)</dfn> that carries out all the computations. It also contains a <dfn class="terminology">register file</dfn>, a small but fast storage facility where the programmer can store 32 values of 32 bits each. Register 0 cannot be written to and always reads 0. This is a “trick” to provide the constant 0 that is frequently used. Like all the other bus participants, the processor is connected to the bus via which it can send and receive data to the rest of the system, including the main memory. The address space of the system we are looking at here is 32-bit, which means that it contains the addresses from <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(2^{32}-1\text{.}\)</span>
