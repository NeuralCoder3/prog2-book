<div class="para">Why do we need registers if we have main memory to store data? There mainly two reasons for having registers:</div>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">Speed.</span></span><div class="para">Retrieving data from main memory is quite slow in comparison to the speed of the processor. For technical reasons, it can take several dozens to hundreds of clock cycles. So it is unpractical for a CPU to retrieve the data it operates on from the main memory constantly.</div>

<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Addressability.</span></span><div class="para">The address of a datum in main memory is 32-bits wide. If the CPU operated on main memory directly, a simple addition would need to invest three times 32 bits to describe the operands and the target memory cell which sums up to 96 bits. This makes the instruction word quite large in comparison to the three times 5 bits needed to address the register file.</div>
