<div class="para">If instructions are fetched from main memory and main memory accesses take so long compared to the speed of the processor, you may wonder why the processor's speed is actually higher than the one of main memory. The reason is that concrete systems use a hierarchy of so-called cache memories between the CPU and the actual main memory. These caches trade-off speed versus size and are able to provide data quicker, cache recently-accessed memory cells and also prefetch data from lower hierarchies that is “likely” to be used next. This has the effect that the instructions that will be fetched in the near future reside very closely to the CPU in the cache hierarchy.</div>
