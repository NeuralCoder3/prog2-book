<div class="para">These instructions take two operands of which one is read from the register file and the other either also from the register file or directly from the instruction word. In the latter case, the operand is called an <dfn class="terminology">immediate</dfn>. Immediates allow for embedding constants into the instruction word which is needed quite often when programming (think of adding 1 to a number for example). The <dfn class="terminology">arithmetic-logical unit (ALU)</dfn> performs all the operations we have discussed in <a href="sec-arith.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 1: Computer Arithmetic">Chapter 1</a> (addition, subtraction, and, or, xor, and more) and writes the result back to the register file. The MIPS processor we look at has a <dfn class="terminology">word size</dfn> of 32 bit which means that the ALU inputs and outputs are 32 bits wide.</div>
