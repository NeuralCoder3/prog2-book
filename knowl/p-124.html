<div class="para">When the processor executes a computation or memory instruction, it increments the program counter byÂ 4 to let it point to the instruction right after the one that is currently been executed. Control flow instructions can influence the value of the program counter in various different ways that we discuss below. Essentially, they serve the purpose to alter the program's flow which is important to implement repeated and conditional execution of code. Without that, computers would not be very powerful because they only could execute a simple list of instructions.</div>
