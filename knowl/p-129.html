<div class="para">We have seen in the last section that the instructions that a processor executes are just bit strings that reside in memory. Because we do not want to encode these bit strings by hand, we use an <dfn class="terminology">assembler</dfn>. An assembler translates a textual representation of machine code into <dfn class="terminology">binary code</dfn>, i.e. the bit strings of the instructions. To this end, the assembler reads in a file that contains machine code instructions in their textual form and <dfn class="terminology">directives</dfn> for the assembler that direct the assembly process and influence the shape of the output. The output of the assembler is a <dfn class="terminology">binary file</dfn> (sometimes called <dfn class="terminology">object file</dfn>). This file contains the binary-encoded machine code instructions, data for the data segment, and meta-data for the <dfn class="terminology">linker</dfn> that binds together multiple object files into an executable program. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-asm-toolchain.html" title="Figure 2.3.1">Figure 2.3.1</a> shows this process schematically. As indicated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-asm-toolchain.html" title="Figure 2.3.1">Figure 2.3.1</a> a program can consist of multiple assembly files. Each such file is called a <dfn class="terminology">translation unit</dfn> because they are all “translated” separately. </div>
