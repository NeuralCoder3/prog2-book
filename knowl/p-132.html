<div class="para">It may seem as a crude “hack” to use conditional branches to branch unconditionally. However, it saves us from introducing a dedicated instruction for that. This way, the instruction set stays small and clean which is part of the <dfn class="terminology">RISC</dfn> (reduced instruction set) paradigm. The assembler however offers <dfn class="terminology">pseudo instructions</dfn> such as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">li</code> (load immediate = put an immediate into a register) or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">b</code> (branch) that are just abbreviations for commonly used operations that can be expressed with the actual instruction set in a not so straightforward way. </div>
