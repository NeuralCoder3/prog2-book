<div class="para">Computing offsets for relative branches is tedious and error-prone. Even worse, if one inserts new code between the branch and its target, the offset has to be recalculated. One of the prime tasks of an assembler is therefore to provide <dfn class="terminology">labels</dfn>. Every entity in an assembler file that will be put somewhere in memory (such as instructions but also static data, <a href="sec-asm-dataseg.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.5: The Data Segment">Section 2.5</a> Every instruction (in general every address in a segment) can be marked with a label that stands for the address of the entity. One can refer to these labels at various places (such as in the operand list of relative branch instructions) and the assembler automatically computes the appropriate offsets for us. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-asm-fact.html" title="Listing 2.3.4">Listing 2.3.4</a> shows the assembly file from which the assembler produced the binary code shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-asm-fact-intro.html" title="Listing 2.3.2: ">Listing 2.3.2</a>. </div>
