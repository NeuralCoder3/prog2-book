<div class="para">Why do we explicitly need to terminate the program with a syscall? <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-asm-fact-main.html" title="Listing 2.3.5">Listing 2.3.5</a> suggests that it is clear that the program ends after the last instruction. However, the instructions of our program are just some bytes in memory and behind these bytes there are other bytes that don't belong to our program. So our processor doesn't “see” the end of our program like we do in the listing above. Therefore, we have to hand back control to the operating system when our program has ended.</div>
