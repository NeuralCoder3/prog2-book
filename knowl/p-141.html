<div class="para">To develop an intuition for what happens during the execution of a program, it is helpful to write down an execution trace of the program. An execution trace lists the instructions in the order they are executed and shows the effect of each instruction. In imperative programming languages (like our assembly language here), the execution of a program consists of multiple (potentially infinitely many) steps. In every step one instruction is being executed. The effect of an instruction is either a change of the <dfn class="terminology">state</dfn> of the machine (changing the contents of a register or a memory cell) or an <dfn class="terminology">external effect</dfn> which is an interaction with the environment (printing to the console, reading from a file, etc.). </div>
