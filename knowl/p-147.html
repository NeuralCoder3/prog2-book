<div class="para">In addition to the code, programs also contain <dfn class="terminology">static data</dfn>. The term “static” means that the extent (the size) of the data is known <em class="emphasis">statically</em> which means it is known prior to the program's execution and does not vary during execution. This means that the memory for static data can be provisioned during assembly and linking and allocated directly when the program is loaded into memory. As we will see later in <a href="sec-asm-segments.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.6: Memory Segmentation">Section 2.6</a>, the memory the program uses is organized into segments that each serve a distinct purpose. The <dfn class="terminology">data segment</dfn> is the segment that holds the static data. </div>
