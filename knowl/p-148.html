<div class="para">The fact that there is statically-allocated memory indicates that there is also dynamically-allocated memory. We do only touch on this in this chapter but will discuss dynamic memory allocation in more detail when we talk about CÂ programming. A large part of the memory programs use is allocated dynamically, i.e. during the runtime of the program. The reason is that in most situations the input to the program influences the amount of memory that has to be allocated, so there is no way of knowing <em class="emphasis">statically</em> (i.e. before the program runs) how much memory we need. Consider, for example, a program that processes an image that the user can select after starting the program. We do not know the size of that image statically. </div>
