<div class="para">When the user starts the program, the operating system loads it into the memory. Each section of the binary (code, data) will be put at specific addresses in the address space of the program. When running MIPS programs and tracing their execution on the lowest level, it is important to know where in memory which part of the program is located. Note that modern machines provide the abstraction of virtual memory which makes it possible that the each program that runs on the machine uses its own address space. The processor, in cooperation with the operating system, takes care of mapping these virtual addresses to the physical ones by a technique called <em class="emphasis">address translation</em>. Virtual memory is beyond the scope of this book. Here, we do not make the distinction of virtual vs. physical memory and only consider a single program at the time.</div>
