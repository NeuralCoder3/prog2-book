<div class="para">As soon as programs get larger there is a danger of producing spaghetti code, i.e. writing very large chunks of code that does not have a clear focus but does multiple things all at once. Such code is hard to understand and almost never correct. Therefore, we want to break up programs into smaller modules with clear responsibilities. Each module consists of a set of <dfn class="terminology">functions</dfn> and is grouped in one sometimes a few translation units. The benefit of writing a subroutine for each single task is that we can develop, debug, test, and reuse such subroutines individually. In this section, we look at the mechanics of defining subroutines in machine code and making them interact using function calls. </div>
