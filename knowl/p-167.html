<div class="para">Let us assume that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">bar</code> is defined in a different translation unit that we do not make any assumption about. So, how can we know that the value we stored into <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">$t0</code> with the first <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">addu</code> is still intact? Now you might say that we have to look inside the code of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">bar</code> to be sure that it doesn't overwrite <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">$t0</code>. This is a bad idea for several reasons: First, if the project is bigger this may mean that you have to look at way more code than your own. Above a certain code size, this is no longer feasible. Second, the implementation of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">bar</code> may change in the future and so might its usage of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">$t0</code>. So it is a good idea to make as few assumptions as possible about the inner workings of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">bar</code>. Pessimistically, we have to assume that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">bar</code> uses <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">$t0</code> for its own purposes.</div>
