<div class="para">Programming with assembly languages is cumbersome, as we have seen in the previous chapter. For this reason, software developers write their code in high-level programming languages. A <dfn class="terminology">compiler</dfn> then translates the program of the high-level language to the machine language. In this process, it handles many of the inevitable troubles of programming in assembly languages:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Assembly programs are not portable. They are always written in the instruction set of a processor family. To run the program on a different processor, it needs to be rewritten entirely. A program written in a high-level language, if there is a compiler for the new processor, can just be re-compiled.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Memory cells in assembly programming are unnamed and can only be accessed by number. The resulting programs are hard to read and understand for programmers. Furthermore, we need to decide which values are held in registers and when they are written to memory. This is particularly problematic if there are not enough registers available and when calling conventions need to be implemented.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Assembly languages provide little syntactical structure. Convenient concepts like the infix notation of mathematical expressions cannot be used in assembly languages. Complex expressions need to be serialized by hand and the intermediate results need to be stored to registers.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Control structures like “Do ... until a condition is satisfied” or “if a condition is fulfilled, do <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> otherwise do <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span>” are cumbersome to implement with branching instructions.</div></li>
</ul>
