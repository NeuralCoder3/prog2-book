<div class="para">In functional programming languages as well as in mathematics, variables have a different meaning than in imperative programming languages. Essentially, both paradigms, functional and imperative, agree that variables are immutably bound when they are declared. In functional languages, they are bound to a value, whereas, in imperative programming, the binding is to the address of a container whose content is mutable. Consequently, there are two ways to evaluate a variable in an imperative programming language: To the address of its bound container (L-evaluation) and to its contents (R-evaluation). We discuss these in detail in <a href="sec-c-expr.html#sec-c-lval" class="internal" title="Subsection 4.8.2: L- and R-Evaluation of Expressions">Subsection 4.8.2</a> and <a href="sec-c0.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Formal Semantics">Chapter 6</a>.</div>
