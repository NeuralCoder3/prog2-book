<div class="para">As mentioned before, C does however allow containers for compound data that have space for more than one value. The separate components of such a container can be addressed individually. We can obtain the address of a byte within a container by adding an offset to the containers address. There can therefore be multiple different addresses to the same container that refer to different positions in the container. Formally, an address is a pair of the container address and an offset, which needs to be a number between 0 and the container's size. Addresses that refer to the same container are totally ordered.  This enables pointer arithmetic, which we discuss in <a href="sec-c-ptr.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.10: Pointers">Section 4.10</a>.</div>
