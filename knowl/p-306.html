<div class="para">Floating-point types are used in numerical programs. They represent an excerpt of the rational numbers. As there are is only a finite number of bits available to represent a value, computations with floating-point values generally involve rounding errors. In longer-running programs, these can propagate without notice, leading to program errors that are hard to detect. It is tempting to program with floating-point values as if they were rational or even real numbers. However, floating-point arithmetic violates many of the essential properties of real and rational arithmetic that we are used to rely on, such as the associative law. CÂ provides three floating-point types: <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">float</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">double</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">long double</code>. They differ in their size (and therefore in their range and precision).</div>
