<div class="para">In C, computations are represented as expressions. C provides a number of binary and unary arithmetic operators. Some of them are overloaded: The same symbol is used for different operand types. For example, the processor needs to perform different operations for adding two floating-point numbers than for adding two integers, but both are represented with the same symbol in C. The C compiler uses the types of the operands to determine which operation is used; the overloading is therefore resolved during the compilation.</div>
