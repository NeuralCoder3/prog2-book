<div class="para">There are essentially two solutions to this problem: The language could define a behavior for such exceptional situations, for example executing error-handling code. This way is pursued among others in Java, C#, ML in the form of throwing <em class="emphasis">exceptions</em>. The program then has a defined behavior for exceptional situations. However, this strategy requires that every operation that could potentially cause an exceptional situation is checked <em class="emphasis">at run time</em> for such a situation. This can slow down program execution <em class="emphasis">significantly</em>. We call a language <dfn class="terminology">type safe</dfn> if every well-typed program cannot get “stuck”, i.e. every input leads to an execution that is defined by the language. Robin Milner coined the following definition of type safety:</div>
