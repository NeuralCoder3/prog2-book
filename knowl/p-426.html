<div class="para">The other approach is to not define a behavior for exceptional situations. This is the way of C. If no behavior is defined for exceptional situations, the implementation does not need to check at run time whether one occurred. Therefore, C makes it potentially easier, in contrast to type-safe languages, to make programs run faster. However, the programmer has no guarantee what the execution does when an exceptional situation occurs. This can lead to severe errors that are very hard to identify. Annex J.2 of the C Standard <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/bib-ISO-C99.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1: ISO/IEC 9899:1999 Draft, ISO C Standard 1999">[1]</a> documents all situations where the behavior is undefined. Among many others, these include: Overflows of signed integer arithmetic, division by <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> forming out-of-bounds pointers, and accessing addresses that do not point to a container.</div>
