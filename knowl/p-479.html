<div class="para">One decision that we have to make is how we handle resizing the array when elements are appended or removed. One way to handle this is to always match the length of the array with the length of the list. Then, for each append and each remove, the array has to be resized. As we discussed before, containers (remember an array is just a container) cannot change their size. To get a bigger container, we need to allocate a new one and copy the data there. So matching the array size to the length of the list would have the overhead of reallocating the array each time and worse, copying all elements in the list over to the new array. Especially when adding a large number of elements to a list (a very common operation), reallocation/copying would have to occur each time when a new element is added.</div>
