<div class="para">A more pragmatic way that is very common in practice is to double the size of the array as soon as it is full and to not change the container when an element is removed. This has the drawback that we often reserve more memory than we actually need (the container has more space than we need for the list) at the benefit of less frequent reallocations. Before considering the implementation of the list operations in detail, let us first theoretically investigate the number of element copies that this policy incurs. It is a simple example of what is called <dfn class="terminology">amortized runtime analysis</dfn>. </div>
