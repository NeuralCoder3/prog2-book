<div class="para">A linked list uses pointers to create a chain of list elements. The list itself consists of nodes of which each contains a payload (the element) and, in case of a singly-linked list, a pointer to the next node in the list. If there is no next node, that next pointer is set to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">NULL</code>. Each node is a container of its own that resides somewhere in memory. So there is no array that contains all nodes which makes it also impossible to access the i-th element in constant time because we need to chase the first <span class="process-math">\(i-1\)</span> pointers to get get to the i-th node.</div>
