<div class="para">For each tree, there is a <dfn class="terminology">directed graph</dfn> in which the nodes of the graph are the tree nodes and there is an edge in the graph from node <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to a node <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is a child of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> A node in a tree that has no children is called a <dfn class="terminology">leaf</dfn>.  A node <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is a <dfn class="terminology">descendant</dfn> of another node <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> if there is a <dfn class="terminology">path</dfn> of edges from <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> in the tree's graph.  A tree is a <dfn class="terminology">binary tree</dfn> if each node has at most two children.  A tree is <dfn class="terminology">labelled</dfn> if each node carries additional information, such as a number or a string for example. That label is often also referred to as a <dfn class="terminology">key</dfn>. It is very common to demand that the children of a node are <em class="emphasis">ordered</em> so that it actually matters if a child is left or a right child in a binary tree, for example. So in fact, when talking about trees, we most often talk about <em class="emphasis">ordered labelled trees</em>. </div>
