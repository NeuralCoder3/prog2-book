<div class="para">One simple way to insert a key into binary search tree while maintaining the search tree property is to insert new nodes as leaves. to this end, we need to find the suitable current leaf under which the new node has to be inserted. This is very similar to searching for the node but instead of returning <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">NULL</code> when the key was not found, we return the leaf at which the search ended. Under this leaf the new node will be added to the tree. Either as its left child if the key to be inserted is smaller than the key of the leaf or as its right child otherwise.</div>
