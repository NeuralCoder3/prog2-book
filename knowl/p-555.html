<div class="para">One possibility to implement such a map would be to use the words directly as keys in a binary search tree. However, comparing two sequences boils down to comparing individual elements in practice. For example, consider comparing "Helmet" against "Hello": We need to compare three characters (H, e, l) before we can discriminate both words because both words share the common prefix "Hel". So comparing two sequences takes in the worst case as long as the shorter of both words. Since we might need to visit several nodes of the search tree until we either find the sequence in question or verified that it is not contained in the map, the overall worst-case runtime is the maximum depth of the BST <em class="emphasis">times</em> the length of the sequence we are looking for.</div>
