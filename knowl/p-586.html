<div class="para">Hashing is widely used in practice because it is very fast, typically faster than search trees. Especially open addressing hash tables, although on first sight less intuitive as separate chaining hash tables, are considered to perform very well mostly because they have very good memory access behavior due to their locality: everything is concentrated in one array. One may want also want to directly place the hashed key-value pairs into the table and not operate with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">void*</code> pointers as we did in our examples for the sake of simplicity. In practice that typically depends on the size of the key-value pair.</div>
