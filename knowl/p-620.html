<div class="para">In this section we give a formal account of a very small subset of C, called C0. We will use mathematics to give precise and unambiguous definitions of what a C0 program is and what it means to execute it. This allows us to precisely define the outcome and effects of a program execution. Essentially, we will develop a framework that allows us to execute (interpret) C0 programs in mathematics. Such a formal description is much more precise than any textual rendition. This formal account will shed more light on notions like pointers, addresses, L- and R-evaluation that we have introduced in the previous section in an informal way. To keep the complexity low, we will only consider a very small subset of C and omit a large part of the “syntactic sugar”.</div>
