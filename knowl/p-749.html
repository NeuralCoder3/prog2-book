<div class="para">Consider <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-corr-hoare.html" title="Figure 7.1.8">FigureÂ 7.1.8</a>. The red program is neither partially nor totally correct because it terminates in a state that does not satisfy the postcondition. The blue program is not totally correct because it is not properly terminating in a state for one input. But it is partially correct, because the properly terminating executions end in states that satisfy the postcondition. The black program is totally and partially correct although there is an execution that aborts. This execution however starts in a state that does not fulfill the precondition.</div>
