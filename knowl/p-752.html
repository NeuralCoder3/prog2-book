<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> gets stuck, the semantics of the machine program that the compiler created for <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is undefined. In that case, this machine program can either (a) diverge, (b) abort, or terminate properly in a state that either (c) satisfies or (d) does not satisfy the post condition. This means that, in the case of undefined behavior, we might not be able to observe a failure! This is the case in (a) and (c). So, when testing or debugging programs it is very helpful to avoid getting stuck (i.e. running into undefined behavior). This can be achieved by using sanitizers which instrument the C program to detect undefined behavior during execution and cause the program to abort in such cases.</div>
