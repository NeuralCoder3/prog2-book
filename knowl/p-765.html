<div class="para">In general, it is advisable to document as much invariants as possible using assertions. They come for free in terms of runtime in the production code because they can just be disabled. They can help to expose bugs and can make it easier to fix them. And they are also helpful for documentation purposes because the denote (at least a part) of the invariant that the programmer had in mind for the particular program point. This holds especially for pre- and postconditions. Note however that the C expression language is often not strong enough to formulate powerful invariants because it does not contain quantifiers like the assertion language we have defined in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-corr-assert.html" title="Definition 7.1.2: Assertion">Definition 7.1.2</a> (they would of course be very hard to check at runtime). Therefore, often only a part of the invariant can be documented in an assertion.</div>
