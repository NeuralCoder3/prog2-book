<div class="para">Testing is a technique for finding bugs in programs. Testing means to construct inputs to the program (or a part of a program such as a module or a single function), the so-called <dfn class="terminology">subject under test</dfn>, executes the program on these inputs, observes its behavior and judges if the outcome was correct. If the outcome was not correct we say that the test failed. If a test failed, we discovered a bug in the program that we can repair. So, a failing test is a witness of a bug. Having an appropriate (in extent and quality) <dfn class="terminology">test suite</dfn> is an important ingredient for increasing the quality for software. However, using tests, we cannot <em class="emphasis">prove</em> the correctness of a program. If all tests of a test suite pass, it does not imply that the program is correct<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-16-hidden.html" title="Footnote 16"><sup> 16 </sup></a>:</div>
