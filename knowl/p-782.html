<div class="para">In general, there are two different paradigms of testing:</div>
<dl class="description-list">
<dt>Specification-based Testing (black-box testing)</dt>
<dd>
<div class="para">Tests are written only with respect to a specification. The code of the subject to test does not have an influence on the test itself. </div>
<div class="para">The advantage is that black-box testing can, because it is based on a specification, uncover missing code if some cases have not been considered or implemented. On the other hand, because it ignores the structure of the program to test, it may be that some code paths are not covered by a black-box test suite.</div>
</dd>
<dt>Structural Testing (“white-box”/glass-box testing)</dt>
<dd><div class="para">uses the structure of the source code to design tests that execute as much code of the subject under test as possible. Based on specific metrics (see <a href="sec-corr-testing.html#sec-corr-coverage" class="internal" title="Subsection 7.3.3: White-box Testing and Coverage">Subsection 7.3.3</a>) one tries to cover (i.e. execute) as much of the code of the subject under test as possible. However, even if a program passes a test suite with good coverage, it doesn't not necessarily mean that it is free of significant bugs because white-box testing can only test what is there and can't test code that is missing. </div></dd>
