<div class="para">uses the structure of the source code to design tests that execute as much code of the subject under test as possible. Based on specific metrics (see <a href="sec-corr-testing.html#sec-corr-coverage" class="internal" title="Subsection 7.3.3: White-box Testing and Coverage">SubsectionÂ 7.3.3</a>) one tries to cover (i.e. execute) as much of the code of the subject under test as possible. However, even if a program passes a test suite with good coverage, it doesn't not necessarily mean that it is free of significant bugs because white-box testing can only test what is there and can't test code that is missing. </div>
