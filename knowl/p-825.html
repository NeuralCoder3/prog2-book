<div class="para">In principle, the following rule says that if we can prove Hoare triples of the first statement and the remainder of the block in which the postcondition of the first statement is the precondition of the remainder, we can derive a Hoare triple of the entire block. Intuitively this is justified by the observation that the first Hoare triple yields that, if <span class="process-math">\(s_1\)</span> terminates, it terminates in a state that fulfills the precondition of the remainder of the block which then, by its Hoare triple, will, (if it terminates) terminate in a state that fulfills <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>
