<div class="para">Before and after each iteration of the loop, <span class="process-math">\(\CVar q\)</span> contains the count of how many times we subtracted <span class="process-math">\(\CVar y\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\CVar x\text{.}\)</span> In the loop, we subtract <span class="process-math">\(\CVar y\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\CVar x\)</span> one additional time and increase <span class="process-math">\(\CVar q\)</span> by one. By doing this, we invalidate that invariant for a moment in the loop body but restore it afterward before reaching the end of the loop body. The intermediate condition <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is true at the point before <span class="process-math">\(\CVar q\)</span> is increased but after <span class="process-math">\(\CVar y\)</span> is subtracted from <span class="process-math">\(\CVar x\text{.}\)</span>
