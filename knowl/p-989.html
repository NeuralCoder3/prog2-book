<div class="para">From the base interface collection, more detailed interfaces and classes are derived: lists, sets, queues, deques (double-ended queues). Queues are data structures where elements can be added to and removed from. Depending on the kind of queue this happens in a first-in last-out style similar to a list or according to a completely different policy as in priority queues. We will not go into further detail about queues here.  In this text, we focus on lists and sets because we have already discussed some of them. We have discussed array lists in <a href="sec-ds-lists.html#sec-ds-arraylist" class="internal" title="Subsection 5.1.1: Array Lists">Subsection 5.1.1</a> and doubly-linked lists in <a href="sec-ds-lists.html#sec-ds-dllists" class="internal" title="Subsection 5.1.3: Doubly-Linked Lists">Subsection 5.1.3</a>. The Java implementation follows our discussion quite closely. The tree sets are self-balancing binary search trees and hash sets are based on the techniques discussed in <a href="sec-ds-hash.html" class="internal" title="Section 5.3: Hashing">Section 5.3</a>.</div>
