<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Block.</span></h4> <div class="para">The Hoare triple for a block just falls back to the Hoare triple of its constituent program (rule [Block]). The empty program <span class="process-math">\(\CTerm\)</span> does nothing so the Hoare triple <span class="process-math">\(\hoare Q\CTerm Q\)</span> is valid.

Intuitively this is justified by the observation that the first Hoare triple yields that, if <span class="process-math">\(s_1\)</span> terminates, it terminates in a state that fulfills the precondition of the remainder of the block which then, by its Hoare triple, will, (if it terminates) terminate in a state that fulfills <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Let us consider the following program, that exchanges the contents of two variables:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq-corr-spec-max-syn-ghost.html">
\begin{equation*}
{\CBlock{\CAssnVV tx \CAssnVV xy \CAssnVV yt}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">When formulating the specification, we run into a small problem: We'd like to express in the postcondition that <span class="process-math">\(\CVar y\)</span> equals the value that <span class="process-math">\(\CVar x\)</span> had <em class="emphasis">at the beginning</em> of the program. However, the program overwrites <span class="process-math">\(\CVar x\)</span> and we cannot relate to <span class="process-math">\(\CVar x\)</span> initial value anymore. This can be solved by using <dfn class="terminology">ghost variables</dfn> (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-corr-spec-max-syn-ghost.html" title="Equation 7.3">(7.3)</a>) that capture the initial values of all variables in the program but are forbidden to be modified by the program itself.</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">So, the Hoare triple, we'd like to prove is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\vdash\hoare{\CVar Y=\CVar y\land\CVar X=\CVar x}
{\CBlock{\CAssnVV tx \CAssnVV xy \CAssnVV yt}}{\CVar Y=\CVar x\land\CVar X=\CVar y}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">For now, we know only the precondition and the postcondition because they are part of our proof goal. But the [Seq] rule requires that we come up with a condition <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> to split up the block Hoare triple into smaller ones. We have to <em class="emphasis">choose</em> <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> so that we can complete the proofs. Initially, it may not be clear how to pick the right <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> so that the proof goes through. In our simple example, we can however exploit the fact that the constituent statements solely are assignment statements: looking back at <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-corr-hoare-assign.html" title="Definition 7.4.1: Hoare triple for the assignment statement">Definition 7.4.1</a> we see that the precondition of the Hoare triple of an assignment is actually <em class="emphasis">derived</em> from the postcondition. We can use this insight to derive all the <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>s in our proof tree. To this end, let us sketch the proof tree first and then derive all the missing <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>s using the assignment's Hoare triple.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/def-corr-hoare-assign.html ./knowl/sec-corr-hoare-mech.html">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\vdash\hoare{R_3}{\CAssnVV tx}{R_2}$}
\AxiomC{$\vdash\hoare{R_2}{\CAssnVV xy}{R_1}$}
\AxiomC{$\vdash\hoare{R_1}{\CAssnVV yt}{Q}$}

\end{prooftree}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now, the assignment Hoare triple determines the <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>s in the following way:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/def-corr-hoare-assign.html ./knowl/sec-corr-hoare-mech.html">
\begin{align*}
R_1\amp =\CVar Y=\CVar x\land\CVar X=\CVar t\\
R_2\amp =\CVar Y=\CVar y\land\CVar X=\CVar t\\
R_3\amp =\CVar Y=\CVar y\land\CVar X=\CVar x
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">We see that the assertions <span class="process-math">\(R_3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> are <em class="emphasis">syntactically</em> the same which completes the proof. We come back to this kind of proof technique in <a href="sec-corr-hoare.html#sec-corr-hoare-mech" class="internal" title="Subsection 7.4.2: Mechanizing Verification">Subsection 7.4.2</a> where we actually develop an algorithm to determine the missing invariants.</div>
