<div class="para">To define the proof rule for the while loop we resort to the concept of a <dfn class="terminology">loop invariant</dfn>. A loop invariant is an assertion that holds true before and after the execution of a loop body. Hence, if some assertion <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is a loop invariant, it will also hold before the loop was entered and after the loop was left (if it was left at all). This gives rise to the following proof rule:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\vdash\hoare{I\land e}s{I}$}
\LeftLabel{[While]}
\UnaryInfC{$\vdash\hoare{I}{\CWhile es}{I\land\neg e}$}
\end{prooftree}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The premise expresses that <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> must be a loop invariant. Note that we can strengthen the precondition because whenever <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is executed, <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> also holds. In a similar way we know that as soon as we have left the loop, <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> will be false, hence we can stipulate the postcondition <span class="process-math">\(I\land\neg e\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">Let us consider an example here as well.

<div class="para">For the correctness proof, we need to remember the original value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> with a ghost variable. The invariant <span class="process-math">\(\CVar q\cdot \CVar y + \CVar x = \CVar X\)</span> is conveniently also the postcondition of the program together with the fact that the remainder is smaller than the divisor. Therefore, we do not need the consequence rule for the while loop.</div> <div class="para">Let us go through the proof from right to left. After the loop, the condition is false. Therefore, we know <span class="process-math">\(\CVar x\lt \CVar y\text{.}\)</span> It remains to show that the invariant <span class="process-math">\(\CVar q\cdot \CVar y + \CVar x = \CVar X\)</span> is true before the loop was entered and in each iteration of the loop.

By doing this, we invalidate that invariant for a moment in the loop body but restore it afterward before reaching the end of the loop body. The intermediate condition <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is true at the point before <span class="process-math">\(\CVar q\)</span> is increased but after <span class="process-math">\(\CVar y\)</span> is subtracted from <span class="process-math">\(\CVar x\text{.}\)</span>
