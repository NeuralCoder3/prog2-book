</h3> <div class="para">While <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lem-arith-uadd.html" title="Lemma 1.3.5: Addition of bit strings is sound">Lemma 1.3.5</a> shows that the addition algorithm we defined is sound, it has a significant practical disadvantage. Our algorithm is a so-called <dfn class="terminology">ripple-carry adder</dfn> which means that the carry “ripples” through the positions: In order to compute <span class="process-math">\(s_i\)</span> you have to have computed <span class="process-math">\(c_i\)</span> for which you need <span class="process-math">\(s_{i-1}\)</span> and so forth. This makes the depth of the actual circuit of ands, ors, xors that implements the adder linear in terms of the number of positions. Since the circuit depth significantly influences the frequency by which you can clock the computer and therefore its speed, practical implementations use different adders, so called <dfn class="terminology">carry-lookahead adders</dfn> that have more gates but are flatter and can therefore be clocked faster. </div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-arith-add.html#remark-1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
